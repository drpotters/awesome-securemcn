# awesome-securemcn

This project..
- Infra: Creates project prefix, unique id, and an enhanced firewall policy (using values that will later be discovered by F5 XC and provided by AWS) and predefined CIDR blocks in Azure and in GCP
- Infra: Creates a new AWS VPC & subnets
- Infra: Creates a new Azure resource group & VNET
- Infra: Creates a new GPC Network & subnets
- Infra: Connects all sites via L3 using an F5 XC global network as a backup and the site mesh group as the primary CE to CE path
- Infra: Creates & attaches a provider managed K8s cluster to the CE SLO subnet in each cloud provider. ***Intent**: the SLO can route to other public subnets having Internet access where existing clusters with ingress endpoints likely already exist.*
- Infra-ish: Deploy an F5 supported NGINX ingress controller in AWS
- Workload: Deploy cloud-provider ingress controllers in Azure and Aws
- Workload: Deploy a distributed app that's L3 routed using provider-specific custom coredns configmaps to steer connections across the environment. *This can be reworked to use other service discovery products like Consul and internal DNS*
- Workload: Add a public ingress point to the app via F5 XC RE using F5 XC DNS records managed service.
